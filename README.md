# nextJS-spotify-clone
its a Spotify clone music application made using next js and PostgreSQL, which has very limited number of songs present, but this app is intended to make a music app with some songs as testing purpose
if you're thinking to use it for your personal use case or as a production deployment, dont forget to add those songs which you dreamt of for this particular project. 

## Apologies for the limitation of the app, Your contributions are always welcome. ;)
